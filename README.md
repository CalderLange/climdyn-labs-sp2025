### climdyn-labs-sp2025


This repository will share labs and other computational tools for ECSC0202 (formerly GEOL0202) at Middlebury College.


To access these materials via the Middlebury College Jupyter Hub all you need to do is 'fork' the repository to your own GitHub account and then head to 'callisto.middlebury.edu'. The labs should appear in your directory on the left side of the interface.
